</p>

## Overview

This custom integration fetches marine weather data from the [Open-Meteo Marine API](https://marine-api.open-meteo.com/v1/marine) and exposes it in Home Assistant as sensors.
It provides current wave and swell conditions for user-defined locations.

## Features

* **Current Marine Weather Data:** Wave height, swell height, direction, and period
* **Compass Conversion:** Converts degrees into compass points (e.g., N, NE, SW)
* **Multiple Locations:** Define as many surf spots as needed in YAML
* **Configurable Timezone:** Each location can use its own IANA timezone string
* **Throttled Updates:** API requests limited to every 30 minutes
* **Error Handling:** Logs HTTP, request, or JSON errors to the Home Assistant log

---
## Requirements
- Home Assistant 2023.12 or later
- HACS installed (if using HACS option)

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Manual Install

Copy the `marine_weather` folder (including all files such as `__init__.py`, `sensor.py`, `const.py`, `manifest.json`, and `logo.png`) into:

```
<config>/custom_components/marine_weather/
```

### Option 2: Install via HACS (Custom Repository)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Custom Repositories**  
2. Add this repository URL:  

   ```
   https://github.com/cloudbr34k84/Open-Meteo-Marine-Weather
   ```

  **Type:** *Integration*  
3. Click **Add**  
4. Search for **Open Meteo Marine Weather** in HACS and install  
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Post-Install

- Verify `const.py` is present (defines `DOMAIN` and `API_URL`)  
- Confirm the integration loads without errors in **Settings ‚Üí Logs**

---

## Configuration

You can configure the integration inline or using split YAML files.

### Option 1: Inline in `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: marine_weather
    locations:
      - name: "Alexandra Headlands"
        latitude: -26.6715
        longitude: 153.1006
        timezone: "Australia/Brisbane"
      - name: "Kings Beach"
        latitude: -26.8017
        longitude: 153.1426
        timezone: "Australia/Brisbane"
```

### Option 2: Split into separate files

‚ö†Ô∏è Use this only if your `configuration.yaml` includes:

```yaml
sensor: !include_dir_merge_list sensors
```

Then create `sensors/marine_weather.yaml`:

```yaml
- platform: marine_weather
  locations:
    - name: "Alexandra Headlands"
      latitude: -26.6715
      longitude: 153.1006
      timezone: "Australia/Brisbane"
    - name: "Kings Beach"
      latitude: -26.8017
      longitude: 153.1426
      timezone: "Australia/Brisbane"
```

Restart Home Assistant to apply changes.

---

## Usage

Each defined location creates one entity:

```
<Location Name> Current
```

Example: `Alexandra Headlands Current`

---

### Attributes include

* **`swell_wave_height` (m)**
  The vertical size of distant, organized swells (not local chop). Bigger swell = larger, more powerful surf.
* **`swell_wave_direction` (¬∞ and compass)**
  Direction the swell is coming from. Important for how it hits your coastline (e.g., east swell vs south swell).
* **`swell_wave_period` (s)**
  Time between swell waves. Longer period = more energy and better surf shape.
* **`swell_wave_peak_period` (s)**
  The dominant swell interval at the moment (the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù period in the mix).
* **`wave_height` (m)**
  Overall wave size at the location (includes local wind chop plus swell).
* **`wave_direction` (¬∞ and compass)**
  Direction the breaking waves are coming from at your spot.
* **`timezone`**
  The timezone used when fetching data. Matches what you set in YAML (e.g., `Australia/Sydney`).
* **`models`**
  Which forecast model the API used. Usually `"best_match"`.

### Understanding the Difference: Waves vs Swell

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bluewatermiles.com/images/extras/waves/swell.webp" width="800">
</p>

**Waves (Wind Waves / Chop)**

* **Origin:** Generated by local winds blowing at that moment
* **Characteristics:** Short-period, messy, irregular tops
* **Direction:** Moves with the local wind
* **Example:** Whitecaps on a windy day

**Swell**

* **Origin:** Produced by large, distant storms that blow for long periods
* **Characteristics:** Long-period, smooth, rolling, and rhythmic
* **Distance:** Can travel thousands of kilometers before reaching your coast
* **Example:** Clean, powerful surf arriving days after a storm far offshore

**In summary:**
Local wind creates short, messy **waves**, while distant storms generate long, organized **swells**. Surf conditions are usually a combination of both ‚Äî the swell provides the main energy, while local wind waves (seas/chop) affect cleanliness and ride quality.

---

## Limitations

* **UI setup not supported.** YAML configuration only
* **Forecast sensors not implemented.** Only ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù data is available

---

## FAQ

* **Q: Why can‚Äôt I add this integration from the UI?**
A: This integration does not include a config flow. It must be configured via YAML.

* **Q: My timezone shows as `Australia/Sydney`, but I‚Äôm in Europe. Why?**
A: Use the `timezone:` option in YAML for each location. Use a valid IANA timezone (e.g., `Europe/Madrid`).

* **Q: I get ‚ÄúNo module named const‚Äù?**
A: Make sure `const.py` is inside `custom_components/marine_weather/`.

* **Q: Can I define locations in multiple YAML files?**
A: Yes. Use `!include_dir_merge_list sensors` in `configuration.yaml` and create a separate `marine_weather.yaml`.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Error: `No module named custom_components.marine_weather.const`**
  ‚Üí Ensure `const.py` exists in the same folder as `sensor.py`

* **Wrong timezone in attributes**
  ‚Üí Check that your YAML includes a valid IANA timezone string (e.g., `Europe/Madrid`)

* **Entities not showing**
  ‚Üí Verify YAML syntax, run *Check Configuration* in Developer Tools, then restart Home Assistant

# üåä Marine Weather Integration ‚Äî Roadmap

This file outlines planned features, improvements, and long-term vision for the **Open Meteo Marine Weather** integration.
The roadmap is aspirational ‚Äî not all features are guaranteed, but it reflects the intended direction.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Quality & Compliance (short-term)

**Goal:** Get the integration accepted into HACS and ensure a solid foundation.

* **HACS Approval Readiness**

  * Repo structure must follow HACS rules (`custom_components/marine_weather`, `brands/marine_weather`, `hacs.json`, `manifest.json`).
  * Ensure `info.md`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` are present and accurate.
* **Error Handling**

  * Gracefully handle missing or partial API data.
  * Show `"N/A"` or placeholder values instead of empty attributes.
  * Log structured warnings in HA‚Äôs system log.
* **Unit Tests**

  * Add pytest coverage for:

    * `degrees_to_compass` utility.
    * Attribute formatting functions.
    * Error/exception handling.

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Usability & Config (medium-term)

**Goal:** Improve user experience by reducing reliance on YAML and making the integration easier to manage.

* **Config Flow (UI Setup)**

  * Add support for HA‚Äôs `config_flow.py`.
  * Users can add integration from **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**.
* **Options Flow**

  * Allow editing of locations and timezones via the UI.
  * Support multiple spots without restarting HA.
* **Model Selection**

  * Open-Meteo supports different models (ECMWF, GFS, ICON).
  * Let users select which model to use in config.
* **Diagnostics Expansion**

  * Extend `diagnostics.py` to show:

    * Last API payload summary.
    * API call frequency.
    * Error count / last error reason.

---

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Expansion (medium/long-term)

**Goal:** Provide richer marine weather coverage.

* **Forecast Entities**

  * Add 3h, 6h, and 24h forecast sensors.
  * Entities: `wave_height_forecast_3h`, `swell_period_forecast_6h`, etc.
* **Wind & Weather**

  * Expose wind wave attributes (height, direction, period).
  * Optionally integrate with HA‚Äôs `weather` entities for combined surf/wind dashboards.
* **Separate Sensors**

  * Current approach: one sensor with many attributes.
  * Planned: break attributes into dedicated sensors (e.g. `sensor.swell_period`, `sensor.wave_height`).
  * Improves Lovelace graphs and history tracking.
* **Tide Integration**

  * Detect local tide entity (e.g. `sensor.local_tide`).
  * Merge into Lovelace card display.
  * Support combined surf + tide dashboards.

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Visualization & UX (long-term)

**Goal:** Deliver a full surf dashboard experience inside Home Assistant by combining marine weather data, tide info, and wind conditions into a dedicated Lovelace card.

* **Marine Wave Card (Core Feature)**

  * Custom Lovelace card (`custom:marine-wave-card`) that visualizes swell, waves, and wind in a surf-report style interface.
  * Features include:

    * Surf height bars (color-coded).
    * Swell period overlays (line chart for consistency/quality).
    * Wind arrows (direction + speed/gusts).
    * 24-hour rolling history with 6-hour ticks.
    * Compact, surf-forecast-style presentation.

* **Wave + Tide Chart Overlay**

  * Optionally combine tide entity data with wave forecasts in the same chart (stacked or dual-axis).

* **Directional Icons**

  * Graphical compass arrows for swell/wave direction.

* **Surf-Friendly Summary**

  * Auto-generate plain-text conditions like:
    *‚Äú3ft clean E swell, 12s period. Low tide 9:45am, rising.‚Äù*

* **Lovelace Card Bundle**

  * Publish the Marine Wave Card to HACS as a standalone frontend package.
  * Provide presets that combine:

    * Marine Weather integration data.
    * Local tide entity.
    * Wind/weather entities.

* **Preset Dashboards**

  * Ready-made ‚ÄúSurf Spot‚Äù dashboard templates (e.g., Sunshine Coast example with Alexandra Headlands, Kings Beach, Moffat Beach).

---

## Phase 5 ‚Äî Advanced Features (future ideas)

**Goal:** Extend integration for power users and automation.

* **REST/Coordinator Refactor**

  * Migrate API fetch into a `DataUpdateCoordinator`.
  * Allow reuse by `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `weather`, and other HA platforms.
* **Adaptive Polling**

  * Faster update intervals during surf hours.
  * Slower updates overnight.
* **Alerts & Automations**

  * Binary sensors or events, e.g.:

    * `binary_sensor.big_swell_alert` (swell > 2m).
    * `binary_sensor.tide_dropping_fast`.
* **External API Expansion**

  * Combine with other oceanographic APIs (NOAA, BOM, Surfline).
  * Offer hybrid data sources for redundancy.

---
